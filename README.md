### How to play:


Codenames is a game of guessing which words in a set are related to a hint-word given by another player. 

Players split into two teams: purple and blue. One player of each team is selected as the team's spymaster; the others are field operatives.

Twenty-five Codename words, are laid out in a 5×5 rectangular grid, in random order. A number of these words represent purple agents, a number represent blue agents, one represents an assassin, and the others represent innocent bystanders.

The teams' spymasters click the 'Spymaster' button, which allows them to see which words represent which color team. Teams take turns. On each turn, the appropriate spymaster gives a verbal hint about the words on the respective cards. Each hint may only consist of one single word and a number. The spymaster gives a hint that is related to as many of the words on his/her own agents' cards as possible, but not to any others – lest they accidentally lead their team to choose a card representing an innocent bystander, an opposing agent, or the assassin.

When the agent guesses a word, they click on it which reveals if they were correct. If the word guessed is not on the agent's team (for example, if the blue team guesses a purple or gray word), their turn automatically ends. If an agent guesses the assassin word, the game ends and their team automatically loses. The team which guesses all of their words correctly is the winning team.
